Coin Listener Server

This project collects information about various coins and serves it through an API. It also provides configuration for Nginx to handle HTTP and HTTPS requests.

Prerequisites

Before running the server and Nginx, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js
Nginx
Running the Coin Listener Server

To start the server that gathers information about coins, follow these steps:

Navigate to the server directory:

bash

cd ./server
Start the server using Node.js:

css

node main
Running Nginx with Different Configurations

To run Nginx with the provided configurations, use one of the following commands, depending on whether you want to use HTTP or HTTPS. Make sure to replace the paths with your actual configuration file paths.

For HTTP

bash

sudo nginx -c /home/savely/Documents/projects/services/coins_listener/http_nginx.conf
For HTTPS

Before running Nginx with HTTPS, you need to obtain an SSL certificate and configure Nginx accordingly. Use the following command:

bash

sudo nginx -c /home/savely/Documents/projects/services/coins_listener/https_nginx.conf
Nginx Configuration

Here is an example configuration for Nginx (http_nginx.conf and https_nginx.conf):

bash

worker_processes auto;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    types {
        text/css css;
        application/javascript js;
        text/html html htm;
    }

    sendfile on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        location / {
            root /home/savely/Documents/projects/services/coins_listener/client/dist;
            index index.html index.htm;
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }

        location /backend {
            rewrite ^/backend/(.*) /$1 break;

            proxy_pass http://localhost:3030;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name localhost;

        ssl_certificate ./ssl/server.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key ./ssl/server.key;

        location / {
            root /home/savely/Documents/projects/services/coins_listener/client/dist;
            index index.html index.htm;
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }

        location /backend {
            rewrite ^/backend/(.*) /$1 break;

            proxy_pass http://localhost:3030;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    }
}
